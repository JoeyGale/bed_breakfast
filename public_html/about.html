<p>Finally take the first left and you will arrive at Simpson Bed and Breakfast.</p>
<br>
<h4><em>From the West Des Moines area.</em></h4>
<p>Take I-235 south and continue on it until reaching exit 68. Take that exit onto highway 5 and then continue until reaching exit 70A for Indianola.</p>

<p>When you arrive at campus, there are maps around the outside to help you navigate through campus and figure out which buildings are located where.
